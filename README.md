# HMS High Altitude Balloon Project

Project to use a helium balloon to take a camera up through the atmosphere to near space taking photos and videos of the planet, then the balloon bursts and falls back to earth with a parachute slowing its descent. An Arduino powered GPS tracker and radio transmitter broadcast the location in real time to a chase car which tracks the ballon course to collect the camera when it lands.
